# datesheet

`datesheet` is a small web app to generate a PDF containing a table with all the
hours of a month on it, with one row per day and one column per hour. This sheet
can be printed and used to track events of interest using pen and paper.

This is a pretty trivial task, although useful to me. One might argue that it
doesn't actually need to be a web app, but it's 2022, what _isn't_ a web app at
this point?

Because it's fun to explore optimization techniques, I've tried out a bunch of
them to make the image as small as possible.

The app currently runs off a 1.2 MB image.
